## Chinese Handwritten Digit Classifier using CNN
A deep learning project that uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify handwritten digits from 0 to 9 in Chinese numerals. The model is trained on a Chinese handwritten digit dataset, achieving high accuracy in digit recognition tasks.

### Project Overview
This project implements a CNN-based classifier to recognize Chinese handwritten digits. It includes:

Data loading & preprocessing

CNN architecture design

Model training & evaluation

Accuracy visualization

### Dataset
The dataset contains grayscale images of handwritten digits (0-9) written in Chinese style.
Each image is labeled with its corresponding digit.

Note: If you want to run this project, youâ€™ll need to download the dataset from the official source
